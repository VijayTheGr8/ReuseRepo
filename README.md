# Design
The application uses 3 tiers.
    Angular based Front End,
    Node and Express based APIs, and 
    MongoDB
   
## 1. UI (Angular + Material Design Skin)
   The application uses an out of the box Angular and Material Design skin. We used angular cli ng commands to spawn the project. See details in [/UI-Angular/README.md](UI-Angular/README.md)
   
   [VP] Added thumbnails for articles that have images

## 2. API (NodeJS and ExpressJS)
   Created a shell API using NodeJS by following this [example](https://www.toptal.com/nodejs/secure-rest-api-in-nodejs)  
   
    Use following commands to run it  
        - npm install  
        - npm start  
    This will start the API server on port 3600. 
 
## 3. Datastore (Cosmos DB with Mongos API)
   Created an out of the box MongoDB on azure using portal.azure.com
